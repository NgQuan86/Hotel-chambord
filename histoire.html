        <h3 class="txt-center" >About us</h3>
        <p class="w-80 txt-center mx-auto">Once upon a time, there was a hotel located in the heart of Paris, built in 1950. The hotel was considered one of the most luxurious in the city, with spacious rooms and modern amenities for guests. It attracted many tourists and celebrities from all over the world.

        Over the years, the hotel gained great popularity and witnessed many important cultural and historical events in Paris. The rooms were always well-maintained, and guests were treated with the utmost respect and luxury.
            
        However, with time, new and more modern hotels began to emerge in the city, offering more sophisticated facilities and elegant designs. The hotel built in 1950 began to lose its popularity and was eventually closed.
            
        But the people of Paris did not forget it. It was still considered one of the most beautiful buildings in the city, and there were many requests to renovate and reopen it. Finally, investors bought the hotel and started a major renovation project.
            
        The hotel was fully restored to its former glory, with luxurious rooms and modern amenities. Guests were amazed by the hotel's timeless charm and elegant atmosphere, and the hotel once again became popular. Today, the hotel built in 1950 in Paris is a symbol of the city's long history and cultural richness. People come from all over the world to experience its timeless charm and elegant atmosphere. It is a gem in the crown of Paris and will forever remain a symbol of the city and its heritage.</p>
    
    <h3 class="m-3">And the future</h3>
    <ul> 
        <li>Market research: This is the first step in developing a hotel's strategy. The hotel needs to understand its target market, what their needs and preferences are, and how the hotel can meet those needs.</li>
        <li>Branding: The hotel needs to have a clear brand image and message that is consistent across all its channels, including its website, social media, and advertising.</li>
        <li>Differentiation: The hotel needs to find ways to differentiate itself from its competitors. This could include offering unique amenities, providing excellent customer service, or having a focus on sustainability.</li>
        <li>Marketing and promotions: The hotel should develop a marketing and promotions strategy that will help attract guests and drive business. This could include offering special packages, promotions, and discounts, as well as advertising in key channels.</li>
        <li>Online presence: A strong online presence is essential for a hotel's success in today's digital age. The hotel should have a professional website, a strong social media presence, and positive online reviews.</li>
        <li>Service excellence: The hotel should focus on providing excellent customer service, which can help build loyalty and attract repeat business.</li>
        <li>Expansion: Once the hotel is established and successful, it may consider expanding its offerings or opening additional locations.</li>
